This project demonstrates a method for improving prediction accuracy by leveraging token probabilities to compute a weighted average.

## Overview

In this approach, we enhance prediction accuracy by following these key steps:

1. **Prompt Engineering**: The model is prompted with a range of options (e.g., 1 to 10) to guide its prediction.
2. **Weighted Average Calculation**: The probabilities of the output tokens are used to compute a weighted average, resulting in a more accurate prediction.

## Key Benefits

- **Improved Accuracy**: By computing the weighted average of token probabilities, we can achieve more precise predictions compared to simple sampling methods.
- **Efficiency**: This method allows for the creation of high-accuracy models even with minimal data.
- **Scalability**: The approach can be easily scaled and applied to various prediction tasks.

## Usage

1. **Set up the prompt**: Design the prompt to encourage the model to choose from a specified range (e.g., 1 to 10).
2. **Compute the weighted average**: Use the token probabilities to calculate the final prediction value.

## Potential Applications

- Predicting continuous values in tasks where traditional sampling might lack precision.
- Building efficient models with limited data.
- Enhancing model performance through simple machine learning techniques.

## Conclusion

This approach provides a straightforward way to boost prediction accuracy using token probabilities, making it a powerful tool for various predictive tasks.
